# Polynomial Fit for Sholl Analysis

This repository contains code to perform polynomial fitting on Sholl analysis data. Sholl analysis is commonly used in neuroscience to analyze the structure of neuronal trees by counting intersections at different radii from the center. The provided code uses polynomial fitting to model the relationship between radius and the number of intersections.

## Features
- Polynomial fitting (adjustable degree) on Sholl analysis data.
- Calculation of important model evaluation metrics:
  - R-squared
  - AIC (Akaike Information Criterion)
  - BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)
- Plotting of both data points and fitted polynomial curve.
- Calculation of standard errors for the fitted coefficients.
